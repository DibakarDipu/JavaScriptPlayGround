	<h1>Section 3.8 - Advance JavaScript - Codding Challange</h1>

	<p><b>--- Let's build a fun quiz game in the console! ---</b></p>

	<ul>
		<li>Build a function constructor called Question to describe a question. A question should include: <br>
		a) question itself <br>
		b) the answers from which the player can choose the correct one (choose an adequate data structure here, array, object, etc.) <br>
		c) correct answer (I would use a number for this)</li>
		<li>Create a couple of questions using the constructor</li>
		<li>Store them all inside an array</li>
		<li>Select one random question and log it on the console, together with the possible answers (each question should have a number) (Hint: write a method for the Question objects for this task).</li>
		<li>Use the 'prompt' function to ask the user for the correct answer. The user should input the number of the correct answer such as you displayed it on Task 4.</li>
		<li>Check if the answer is correct and print to the console whether the answer is correct ot nor (Hint: write another method for this).</li>
		<li>Suppose this code would be a plugin for other programmers to use in their code. So make sure that all your code is private and doesn't interfere with the other programmers code (Hint: we learned a special technique to do exactly that).</li>
	</ul>
